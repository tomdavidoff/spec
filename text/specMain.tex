\section{Literature Review}

Infill (as opposed to tract) homes can be built as either ``spec'' or ``custom.'' A spec home is built by a developer without a particular buyer in mind and sold sometime after land is purchased and commonly after construction is completed. A custom home is built for a particular buyer, and that buyer commonly will purchase the land prior to project start.\footnote{See, e.g. \textcite{durrani2023tract}.}

\textbf{Rationality of builders}
\textcite{murphy2018dynamic} extends the dynamic analysis in \textcite{Bulan2009} and finds that land owners are forward-looking with respect to costs and prices in the timing of their investments.
\textcite{baum-snow2024microgeography} show that land tends to be developed when it is close to employment, flat, less developed, and less regulated.

\textcite{DPS} and \textcite{brueckner2024ADUs} discuss the placement and price impacts of ADUs in Vancouver and Los Angeles, respectively. Notably, both find that ADUs are less commonly placed in affluent neighbourhoods.
